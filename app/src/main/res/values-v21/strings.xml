Finally, an assessment toward your readiness of change level will redirect to a certain group whre IF - THEN statements tailored to your needs will be available to you for their implementation.\n\n
        The "Agents" page is where you can see your targets that have been set up by you for the specific day as well as for the entire week. Also, a final option lets you have a look at your accomplishments, where you need to focus more in the futeure, as well as your total number of collected points and bonuses.\n\n
        The "EDU" page is a simple formed guide for developing effective and personalized IF - THEN statements. Completing the available test, you verify your acquired knowledge and then an option of wording your own IF-THEN statements will be available to you. Thiw means that you no longer need to depend to predetermined IF_THEN statements, instead you can create your own tailored to your personal needs.
